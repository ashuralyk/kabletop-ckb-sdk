The following operational interfaces are provided:
> 1. Create CKB transactions to interact with Kabletop contracts.
> 2. Provide build-in P2P module to enable easily implementing P2P client and server, but it's unstable now and will be soon replaced with more stable P2P crates.
> 3. Implement simple wallet manager to manage plaintext keys, and will upgrade to support universal keys management tools like WalletConnect soon.
